Help, something is wrong. I hear voices that are not mine. The first is angry, the second one is sad. I named them Err0R and Mask. They speak
to me and sometimes they speak for me. I don't know what my part is. I think I am not real anymore, I think I am just a projector for them now. Stop, no please don't. You are right, I'm a failure.
